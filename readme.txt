Functions to fix/improve:
Improve accuracy of face detector
Print result feature (need to make it normal color)
improve look of ui (optional but is nice to have)
further testing and results of facial recognition (aiming to have consistent positive hits)


Things to add/change:
Change it so that the program would only try to recognize 1 person
Alternatively, can also make a toggleable option before the face detector launch option is pressed
Limit the real time recognition attempt to a couple (maybe 5) seconds after hitting the start
Following that short time frame, the print function may be automatically done so as to remove the button itself.



Not yet implemented features:
Suggested haircut/styles can be shown at the right hand side from the camera
